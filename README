Description

This class provides the ability to search and manipulate a simple dictionary.
It was originally designed for checking surnames encountered during the
preparation of census indices. It works best with small data sets and where the
names in the data set generate many distinct soundex values. The dictionary is
maintained in memory and hence the memory usage depends on the number of names.

See the the documentation for full details. This module requires Text::Soundex to be installed on your system.
